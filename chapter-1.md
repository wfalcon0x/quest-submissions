### 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.

*Mivel biztos vagyok benne hogy Jacob nem tud magyarul, azt irhatok ide amit akarok :) Na jo, ez meg nekem is konnyebb lesz angolul.*

*The blockchain is a distributed database, where each of the nodes stores a complete ledger of the transactions. These transactions are immutable, thus serves as a permanent record.*

### 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. 

*Smart contract is a small program describing a set of rules we want to automatically execute once its deployed to  the blockchain.*

### 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

*Script is about querying information from the blockchain, transaction is to run a function on the blockchain which can change the stored information. Scripts are free to run, transactions has a fee.*

Please feel free to answer in the language of your choice.

### 1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

- safety and security
- clarity
- approachability
- developer experience
- resource oriented programming


### 2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

*These enables a wider range of people to learn and create secure smart contracts. In essence it further helps democratise the use of blockchain.*
